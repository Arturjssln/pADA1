						Before 2013, the U.S. government was running many global surveillance programs in the total ignorance of the people through its biggest security agency, the National Security Agency (NSA). In June 2013, an american whistleblower, Edward Snowden, exposed the truth about the illegal surveillance programs to the eyes of the world by leaking information in the media. The revelation of classified details from United States government surveillance programs prompted a cultural discussion about national security and individual privacy. 
						As a result of these announcements, Dr. Jon Penney provided evidence of regulatory “chilling effects” of Wikipedia users associated with online government. Indeed, he showed that traffic to Wikipedia articles on topics that raise privacy concerns for Wikipedia users decreased.<br>
						Wikipedia can be seen as a good sample of the population, but...

						<h3>How are Wikipedia's users behaving?</h3>
					</header>
					<p>
						As it has been developped in Penney's article, we observe a difference in the way the users are searching for Wikipedia articles.
						In response to the new discoveries of surveillance, we can observe a slight decrease of the total number of views of terrorism-related articles.
						More importantly, before 2013, the total number of views had a tendency to increase over time. 
						After 2013, as can be seen on the following graph , the trend is going down. 
						This is proof that, the revelations from Snowden had an immediate effect and suggest that there is also a long-term effect.  
						To verify that the previous hypothesis is not a consequence of a general trend, he compared the result with similar articles that don't raise any privacy concern.
						These articles are security-related and cannot be defined as group-control but as comparator groups. 
						The goal of this group is to show that for other security-related topics (that should interest the same category of person) that that do not raise privacy concerns, the revelations had less or no effect.

					<p>
						The previous graph show that the effect is much higher for the terrorism-related articles than for the control group.
						Thus, we can infere that the hypothesis might be verified.
