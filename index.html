						Before 2013, the U.S. government was running many global surveillance programs in the total ignorance of the people through its biggest security agency, the National Security Agency (NSA). 
						In June 2013, an american whistleblower, Edward Snowden, exposed the truth about the illegal surveillance programs to the eyes of the world by leaking information in the media. 
						The revelation of classified details from United States government surveillance programs prompted a cultural discussion about national security and individual privacy. 
						As a result of these announcements, Dr. Jon Penney provided evidence of regulatory “chilling effects” of Wikipedia users associated with online government. 
						Indeed, he showed that traffic to Wikipedia articles on topics that raise privacy concerns for Wikipedia users decreased.
						Wikipedia can be seen as a good sample of the population, but...

						<h3>How are Wikipedia's users behaving?</h3>
					</header>
					<p>
						As it has been developped in Penney's article, we observe a difference in the way the users are searching for Wikipedia articles.
						In response to the new discoveries of surveillance, we can observe a slight decrease of the total number of views of terrorism-related articles.
						More importantly, before 2013, the total number of views had a tendency to increase over time. 
						After 2013, as can be seen on the following graph , the trend is going down. 
						This is proof that, the revelations from Snowden had an immediate effect and suggest that there is also a long-term effect.  
						To verify that the previous hypothesis is not a consequence of a general trend, he compared the result with similar articles that don't raise any privacy concern.
						These articles are security-related and cannot be defined as group-control but as comparator groups. 
						The goal of this group is to show that for other security-related topics (that should interest the same category of person) that that do not raise privacy concerns, the revelations had less or no effect.

					<p>
						The previous graph show that the effect is much higher for the terrorism-related articles than for the control group.
						Thus, we can infere that the hypothesis might be verified for Wikipedia users.

									<b>Google</b> requests is more representative of people's habits, indeed the number of user is way larger on Google than Wikipedia. 
									A similar analysis should be done on Google's data to assess the presence of a chilling effect. 
									First, let's see the interest over two different periods. On Figure 2, there is no evidence of chilling effects.
									However, this plot is not representative of the underlying trends! 
									What if there were an immediate chilling effect after the revelations but no long term effects ? 
									Let's continue our analysis!

									In order to represent the trend of the interest in the terrorism-related subjects over time, we are using a regression for both periods, similarly to what have been done for Wikipedia.

								<p>
									We observe a slight decrease of 8% (even more if we look at the points, the regression overestimate the interest in the beginning) in the interest after the Snowden revelations.
									It could be considered as a short-term chilling effect. However, very fast the trend is catching up with his old value and after 3 months, there are no effect anymore.
									Now, I'm sure you're wondering...

									<b>Oh no... we forgot to check if there were some data that could mislead our analysis.</b> Indeed, the way one interact with Wikipedia ang Google are very different.
									Wikipedia is used to do some research, to learn new things, to check a fact, etc. 
									We rarely go on wikipedia to look at the <i>attack</i> article just after an attack happened. 
									We would most probably just write <i>Attack</i> on Google. 
									Consequently, Google requests are stronlgy related to the news. 
									It is obvious when we take a closer look at some research terms such as <h3>TODO: trouver quels termes et est ce qu'on inclu un graph ????</h3> 
									that some events induce some huge peak of interest around these events. 
									This sensitivy to world events induce a lot of noise in the data and could lead to false interpretation.
									Finally, after removal of these subject that we call <i>outliers</i>, we should have a new look to the trends!

									<b>How surpising!</b> 
									Did you notice that the terrorism trends seems to be completely independent to surveillance programs' exposure?
									Indeed, when we remove the data that are related to news event, we don't see any chilling effect at all. 
									An answer to this mystery could be that we have two categories of people. The first category could be called the 
									<i>GHALI C'ETS TON MOMENT (si tu connais un mot qui décrit les personnes qui s'intéressent à un sujet uniquement quand c'est dans l'actualité) </i>,
									they have a tendency to be interested only in hot topics but wouldn't be interested in this subject normally.
									The second group includes people that would search for this topic in everyday life (for research purpose, ...).
									Our hypothesis is that the first category of people, the <i>REUSE THE PREVIOUS FOUND WORD HERE</i>, is affected by the chilling effect,
									while the second one is not.
